# Piano
Records your Piano keys to an a list to save you time with my other coding project Piano-Robot.
This Program is used in conjunction with an arduino that plays the piano.
Play notes as you would a real piano and click whole note, half note, quater note depending on the duration of the note.
When you are finished click Fin and a file will then be downloaded.
That file contains all the notes that you played.
Copy and paste those notes into the arduino code in the arraylist notes[]
Then upload the code to your piano robot and your robot will start playing some beautiful music.
Enjoy
